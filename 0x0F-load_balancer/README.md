# Custom HTTP Response Header & Load Balancer Setup

## Project Overview

This project includes scripts and configurations to customize HTTP response headers and set up a load balancer for web applications. The repository contains the following files:

### Files

1. **`0-custom_http_response_header`**

   - A script or configuration file to define and apply custom HTTP response headers for a web server.

2. **`1-install_load_balancer`**

   - A script to automate the installation and basic configuration of a load balancer for distributing traffic across multiple servers.

3. **`2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp`**
   - A Puppet manifest for managing the custom HTTP response header configuration on servers.

## Usage

### 1. Custom HTTP Response Header

- **File:** `0-custom_http_response_header`
- **Purpose:** Sets specific HTTP headers to enhance security, improve performance, or provide additional metadata in server responses.
- **Usage:**
  - Apply the script or configuration file to your web server (e.g., Apache, NGINX) to enable custom headers.
  - Test by sending HTTP requests and inspecting the response headers.

### 2. Load Balancer Installation

- **File:** `1-install_load_balancer`
- **Purpose:** Simplifies the process of setting up a load balancer for distributing traffic evenly across multiple backend servers.
- **Usage:**
  - Run the script on your server to install and configure a load balancer (e.g., HAProxy, NGINX).
  - Verify the load balancer functionality by testing the traffic distribution.

### 3. Puppet Manifest

- **File:** `2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp`
- **Purpose:** Automates the deployment of custom HTTP response headers across servers using Puppet.
- **Usage:**
  - Apply the Puppet manifest to your infrastructure.
  - Ensure all target servers reflect the custom header configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of server configurations.
- A web server (e.g., Apache, NGINX) installed.
- Puppet installed for using `2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp`.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>
   ```
2. Follow the usage instructions for each file based on your setup needs.

## Testing

- Use tools like `curl`, Postman, or browser developer tools to inspect HTTP response headers.
- Perform load testing to verify the load balancer is functioning correctly.
