# Web Infrastructure Evolution Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates the progressive development of web infrastructure designs,
showcasing different architectural approaches and considerations for scaling,
securing, and optimizing web applications.

## Infrastructure Stages

### 0. Simple Web Stack

**File:** `0-simple_web_stack`

- Basic, foundational web infrastructure
- Includes essential components for a minimal web application
- Serves as the starting point for understanding web hosting basics

### 1. Distributed Web Infrastructure

**File:** `1-distributed_web_infrastructure`

- Introduces distributed architecture concepts
- Implements load balancing
- Improves availability and performance
- Demonstrates horizontal scaling principles

### 2. Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure

**File:** `2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure`

- Adds comprehensive security measures
- Implements monitoring and logging
- Focuses on:
  - Firewall protection
  - SSL/TLS encryption
  - Intrusion detection
  - Performance monitoring
  - Logging and audit trails

### 3. Scale Up

**File:** `3-scale_up`

- Advanced scaling strategies
- Modular architecture design
- Demonstrates:
  - Microservices approach
  - Containerization
  - Advanced load balancing
  - Elastic scaling capabilities
