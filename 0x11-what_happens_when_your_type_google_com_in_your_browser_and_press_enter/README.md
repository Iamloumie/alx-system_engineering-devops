# What Happens When You Type "https://www.google.com" and Press Enter?

## Project Overview

This repository explores one of the most fundamental and insightful interview questions in software engineering:
explaining what happens when you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and press Enter.
This question has remained relevant and valuable because it tests a candidate's comprehensive understanding of web technologies, networking, and system design.

## Interview Context

This question is frequently used across various software engineering positions,
from front-end development to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).

Its versatility lies in how it can be tailored to focus on different aspects of web technology,
making it an excellent tool for assessing a candidate's depth of knowledge in specific areas.

### Key Interview Tips

When approaching this question in an interview setting:

1. Always ask the interviewer if they would like you to focus on any specific aspect of the workflow
2. Be prepared to dive deep into different areas based on the role:
   - Front-end positions: Focus on DOM rendering and browser behavior
   - SRE positions: Emphasize load balancing and infrastructure
   - Full-stack positions: Cover the entire request-response cycle
3. Pay special attention to DNS (Domain Name System) concepts, as this is often a challenging area for candidates

## Repository Contents

This repository contains two main components:

- `0-blog_post`: A detailed explanation of the entire process
